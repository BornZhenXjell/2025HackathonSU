## Inspiration 
We wanted to improve communication at the campus through the creation of a general use campus app. 

## What it does 
Currently it stands as a template for further development, such as interactive maps of each floor of each building on campus, which shows the room numbers of every room, as well as the office hours of each teacher, and where their offices are, among other ideas.

## How we built it 
Pure html with some css styling.

## Challenges we ran into 
Language barriers, learning html and css coding languages, and styling the website through css for both desktop and mobile.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
We're proud of the work we have done to create a usable template. It is not close to the idea we had, but it is a start, and hopefully someone (preferably on campus) would pick up the project to continue it, so that it becomes an actual product.

## What we learned 
We learned how to code webpages with html, and styling those pages with either html or css.

## What's next for HackSU2025 - Seattle University Campus App 
Hopefully a resident campus student is interested in taking control of this project, and making it become an actual product that can be used by the general student population at SU.
